⚠️ Short Summary of Errors with File Names


---

❗ 1. Gradle Configuration Issue:

Error:

:app:kotlinKaptWorkerDependencies is incorrectly set as:

both resolvable and consumable

both consumable and declarable



Fix Suggestion:
Update your Gradle config (build.gradle.kts or build.gradle) to ensure this configuration is only one of them — not both.



---

❗ 2. Missing Kotlin/Java Directories:

Missing:

/app/src/main/kotlin

/app/src/debug/kotlin

/app/src/debug/java


Fix Suggestion:
Create these directories if they are part of your module structure, or update your sourceSets if not needed.



---

❗ 3. Unresolved References (likely missing imports or Compose dependencies):

File	Line	Error

NotificationWorker.kt	33	Unresolved reference: notificationsEnabled
CreateGoalScreen.kt	28	Unresolved reference: Composable
CreateGoalScreen.kt	34–38	collectAsState errors (probably missing import androidx.compose.runtime.*)
CreateGoalScreen.kt	126	Unresolved reference: size
DashboardScreen.kt	31	Unresolved reference: Composable
DashboardScreen.kt	38–39	Unresolved reference: collectAsState
DashboardScreen.kt	92, 115, 135, 140, 159	UI elements missing: Card, Button, LinearProgressIndicator
GoalDetailScreen.kt	48, 67, 76, 80	LaunchedEffect, Edit, Box, CircularProgressIndicator
SettingsViewModel.kt	48, 56	Unresolved reference: saveUserSettings


Fix Suggestion:

Ensure you have Jetpack Compose dependencies added in your build.gradle.

Add necessary import statements.

Make sure any custom functions like saveUserSettings() actually exist or are correctly imported.

❗ 4. Missing Dependencies:

Gradle couldn’t download:

error_prone_annotations

javac-shaded


Cause: Missing or blocked Maven URLs.

Fix Suggestion:

Make sure you have internet access and proxy/firewall isn’t blocking Maven.

Double-check repositories block:

repositories {
    google()
    mavenCentral()
}

❗ 5. Compilation Failed

Final error:

Execution failed for task ':app:compileDebugKotlin'.
> Compilation error. See log for more details

Fix:
Resolve the above unresolved references and missing files/imports, and the compilation will succeed.
